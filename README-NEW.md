## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

Main Take Away: Start from what you know, then to what you don't know.
 When I saw this task at first, I was shocked because I did'nt know where to start. The challenge may look challenging at first glance....but let me encourage you and tell you to just start from the basic; A html file, then start styling.
Imagine I learnt HTML yesterday and CSS today and I was able to do the task the same day. You can do it too....KUDOS!!!

### Continued development

I am still not confortable with importing font but I'm working on it.

### Useful resources

- [GITHUB]- This helped me get an idea of where to start.
- [W3schools]- Finally, I'd recommend this cite to anyone interested in learning programming. 
- [ALISON] - Good for learning anything.
- [YOUTUBE] - A combo of this the above three sources and this one, I'd highlighly recommend.
